# -College-Placement-Management-Module
The College Placement Management Module is a web-based application designed to manage and streamline placement-related activities in an academic institution. This module addresses the challenges of manually handling student data, job postings, company details, and placement schedules. Built using Spring Boot, it offers a robust backend for efficient operations and a user-friendly frontend for seamless interaction.

The system provides role-based access for three key stakeholders:

Students: Register and manage their placement profiles, browse job opportunities, and track application statuses.
Placement Coordinators: Manage placement activities, including job postings, company records, and placement schedules.
Administrators: Oversee the entire system, manage users, and generate placement reports.
This project ensures better coordination, reduced manual effort, and enhanced data accuracy for all placement activities within a college environment.
